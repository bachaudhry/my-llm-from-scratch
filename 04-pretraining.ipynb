    "**`Perplexity`** This is a measure used in conjuction with cross entropy loss to evaluate the performance of models in tasks like language modeling. It can provide a more interpretable way to understand the uncertainty of a model in predicting the next sequence. Specifically, it measures how well the probability distribution predicted by the model matches the actual distribution of the words in the dataset. Lower perplexity indcates that the model predictions are closed to the actual distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This measure is often considered to be more interpretable than the raw loss value because it signifies the effective vocabulary size that the model is _unsure_ of."
